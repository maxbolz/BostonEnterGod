            A Visualization

            <div class = "textabout">
                Seen here is a chart comparing the number of churches in all plates.
                White bars represent churches in 1902, while yellow ones represent
                churches in 2023. The y-axis is simply the number of churches found
                per plate.

            The Numbers
            </div>
            <div class = "textabout">
                As deduced by this experiment, the average number of churches per plate for both years can
                be seen here, along with the standard deviations, 
                and the difference in churches per plate as a percent.

            So What?
            </div>
            <div class = "textabout">
                The hypothesis of this experiment was that the number of churches in Boston,
                and the change thereof, would correspond with the difference
                in religious demographic data between the two time periods.

              In A Nationwide Sense
            </div>
            <div class = "textabout">
                The United States has reported a 12% decrease in Christianity between
                the two time periods, according to census information. Even though Massachusetts is decently Christian,
                the number of churches has decreased by 3 TIMES this amount. According to 1902
                census information, there were 196,670 churches in the United States in 1906. Now,
                there are 380,000 churches in the United States. Even though this is a stark increase,
                comparing the number of churches to the population says otherwise. In 1906, there
                were 433.8 churches per person. Now, there is 885.2 churches per person in the U.S.;
                a 50% INCREASE from 1906!

              In Conclusion
            </div>
            <div class = "textabout">
                The nationwide average is not reflective of Boston's! Therefore, Boston is a
                unique case when it comes to religion. From this, we are able to conclude that
                Boston truly IS growing as a cultural center, as against all odds and statistics
                of the United States, it has proved that cultural diversity is still blooming.
                This makes sense, and can also be backed up by the simple fact that Massachusetts was
                primarily settled by Puritans; as time went on, only another mass migration could
                prevent a decrease in Christianity.
